# Self-Paced Online Course: Introduction to Infographics

This page provides access to an Infographics self\-paced online Quercus course that focuses on best practices for creating infographics.

**Course Description:**

Through a combination of lecture and activities, this self\-paced online course will introduce participants to best practices and guidelines for designing effective infographics and evaluating them. Participants will get a chance to go through the entire design process of an infographic, from determining the story, sketching the layout, choosing appropriate data visualizations, selecting fonts and colours, and finally using a common online infographic creation tool called [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/), to implement the design and create a finished infographic.
